# @codespar/mcp-adyen

MCP server for [Adyen Checkout API v71](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/71/overview) — the global enterprise payments rail used by iFood, Uber, Spotify, and AirBnB in LatAm.

Distinct from every other server in our catalog: it's the one gateway enterprise merchants choose when a single contract has to cover BR + EU + US + APAC.

## Install

```bash
npm install @codespar/mcp-adyen
```

## Environment

```bash
ADYEN_API_KEY="..."              # X-API-Key value, secret
ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT="..."     # Merchant account code injected into every call
ADYEN_ENV="test"                 # test | live. Default: test.
ADYEN_LIVE_URL_PREFIX="..."      # Required when ADYEN_ENV=live. Your merchant-specific prefix from Customer Area.
```

## URL routing

- `ADYEN_ENV=test` → `https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v71`
- `ADYEN_ENV=live` → `https://<ADYEN_LIVE_URL_PREFIX>-checkout-live.adyenpayments.com/checkout/v71`

Live calls fail fast if `ADYEN_LIVE_URL_PREFIX` is missing.

## Run

```bash
# stdio (default)
npx @codespar/mcp-adyen

# HTTP
MCP_HTTP=true MCP_PORT=3000 npx @codespar/mcp-adyen
```

## Scope

This v0.1 covers **Checkout API v71** only. Separate packages for Adyen **Payouts**, **Management**, and **Balance Platform** APIs follow when demand emerges — each has distinct auth, URL prefix rules, and use cases.

## Enterprise

Need governance, budget limits, and audit trails for agent payments? [CodeSpar Enterprise](https://codespar.dev/enterprise) adds policy engine, payment routing, and compliance templates on top of these MCP servers.

## Authentication

Set these environment variables before launching the server:

- `ADYEN_API_KEY` *(required, secret)* — Adyen API key (generated in Customer Area → Developers → API credentials)
- `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` *(required)* — Adyen merchant account code (appears in most request bodies)
- `ADYEN_ENV` — test | live. Defaults to test.
- `ADYEN_LIVE_URL_PREFIX` — Required when ADYEN_ENV=live. Your merchant-specific prefix, e.g. 1797a841fbb37ca7-AdyenDemo

Issue credentials at the provider's developer portal: <https://docs.adyen.com>.
